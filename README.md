ðŸŒ² Random Forest from Scratch â€“ Gender Classification

This notebook demonstrates a complete Random Forest implementation from scratch using Python â€” including a custom-built Decision Tree that supports both classification (with Information Gain) and regression (with Mean Squared Error).  
At the end, we showcase a practical example of predicting gender using the trained model.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy for numerical computations  
- Pandas for data handling  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
(No external ML libraries like scikit-learn are used â€” everything is built from first principles.)

### ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download this notebook.  
2. Ensure your dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) is placed in the `data/` folder.  
3. Run all cells in order.  
4. Scroll to the bottom to see a sample gender prediction using the custom Random Forest model.
